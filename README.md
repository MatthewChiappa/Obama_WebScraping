# Obama_WebScraping
Data Mining Application 

This is a program that uses a Python data mining website in order to 
collect the transcripts of every President Obama speech from 2004 till now. 
The words over the 350 speeches are processed and the words said most often 
are displayed on a stencil of President Obama. The final stencil and original image
is contained in the project.
